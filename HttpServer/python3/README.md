# Challenge Tasks

In this challenge, I am building an HTTP server that's capable of handling simple GET/POST requests, serving
files and handling multiple concurrent connections.

- [x] Bind to a port
- [x] Respond with 200
- [x] Respond with 400
- [ ] Respond with content
- [ ] Parse headers
- [ ] Concurrent connections
- [ ] Get a file
- [ ] Post a file

```sh
# Start the server
python3 server.py


# send a GET request
curl -X GET localhost:4221
```
